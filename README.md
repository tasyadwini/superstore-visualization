# Superstore Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This project showcases data visualization using Tableau, leveraging the Superstore dataset. The goal is to analyze business performance, identify trends, and extract insights using various visualization techniques.
## Dataset
The Superstore dataset is a sample retail dataset containing sales, profit, and customer details across different regions. It includes:
- Orders (Sales, Profit, Discount, Category, Sub-category, etc.)
- Customers (Customer name, Segment, Region, etc.)
- Geographical Data (State, City, Postal Code)
## Visualizations
Throughout this project, I explored and implemented various visualization techniques, including:-
- Gantt Charts â€“ To analyze order processing timelines
- Maps â€“ For geographical insights on sales distribution
- Tree Maps â€“ To highlight sales and profit contributions by category

Other Tableau Features â€“ Interactive dashboards, filters, and calculated fields
